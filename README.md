# Science and Technology Fairs Website Redesign

Welcome to the official repository for the **Science and Technology Fair Website Redesign Project**, developed for the **Tech Fair 2025**. This project is an initiative by members of the Science & Tech Club from Burnside High School to modernize, improve, and enhance the club's current web presence.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The current Science and Technology Fair's website is outdated, hard to navigate, and not mobile-friendly. For the 2025 Tech Fair, we are rebuilding it from the ground up with a fresh design, better structure, and improved features.

- Allow future members to update content easily.
- Improve user experience with more interactivity and better navigation.

- 🧪 Dedicated sections for Events, Projects, Members, and Resources
- 📸 Photo gallery and video highlights
- 📆 Club calendar and announcements board
- 📩 Contact form and newsletter signup
- ⚙️ Admin-friendly structure for easy content updates

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
