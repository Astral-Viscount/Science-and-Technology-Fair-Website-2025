                <h2>What is a Science and Technology Fair?</h2>
                <p>A science and technology fair is an event where students showcase their projects and research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. These fairs provide a platform for students to present their findings, engage with peers, and receive feedback from judges and experts. The goal of a science and technology fair is to encourage students to explore their interests in STEM, develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and foster a love for learning and innovation.</p>
